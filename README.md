## Convolutional neural network
This is a Theano implementation of a convolutional neural network. It is possible to configure all the settings, including
number of convolutional layers. The system also include hooks for a web interface, for monitoring experiments. A web interface
can be used to stop a running job, and other things. The purpose of this system is to create a road extraction system.
